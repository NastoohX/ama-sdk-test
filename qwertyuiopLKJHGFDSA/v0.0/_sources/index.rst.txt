|SDK|
#####

The |SDK| is a complete software stack allowing users to seamlessly leverage the hardware accelerated features of Xilinx video codec units and enable high-density real-time transcoding for live streaming video service providers, OEMs, and Content Delivery Network (CDNs). Included in the |SDK| are pre-compiled versions of FFmpeg which integrate video transcoding plug-ins for Xilinx devices, enabling simple hardware acceleration of video decoding, scaling and encoding. The |SDK| also provides a C-based application programming interface (API) which facilitates the integration of Xilinx video codec units transcoding capabilities in proprietary frameworks.

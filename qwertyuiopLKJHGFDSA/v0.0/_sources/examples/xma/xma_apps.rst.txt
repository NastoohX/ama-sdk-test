The examples in the |LOC_PATH_XMA|/bin folder illustrate how C-based applications can natively interact with |SDK| devices using  the XMA (Xilinx Media Accelerator) APIs. The examples are for advanced use-cases where using the FFmpeg command-line interface is not appropriate.

Detailed documentation on the |SDK| plugin interface and the XMA APIs can be found in the :doc:`C API Programming Guide </c_apis>` section of the documentation.

.. rubric:: Requirements

- The XMA applications has been built for and verified on a supported OS.
- The XMA applications only work with elementary streams. Container formats such as mp4 are not supported.

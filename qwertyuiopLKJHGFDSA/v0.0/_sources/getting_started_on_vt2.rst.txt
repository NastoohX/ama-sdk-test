Quick Start Guide for |VT2|
***************************

#. Launch an |VT2| Instance

   - Follow the instructions at `Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance>`_

   - When choosing the instance type in the EC2 console, make sure to select the |VT2| instance family. 

   - When choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), make sure to select version 3.0 of one of the `Xilinx Video SDK AMI for VT1 Instances <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=VT1&CREATOR=c68d4b68-cde0-47b8-bc40-a1c2886ca280&filters=CREATOR>`_

   - To get more information about |VT2| instances sizes and pricing see the `VT1 web page <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/vt1/>`_

#. Connect to the |VT2| Instance

   - After launching the instance, follow the instructions in `Connect to your instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux>`_ to connect to the instance. 

#. Install the |SDK| examples by following the steps described in the :ref:`package feed setup <package-feed>` page.

#. Set up the runtime environment::

    source startup.sh

   - Notes to be added
   - You are now ready to use the video acceleration features of your |VT2| instance. 

#. Run your first examples

   - See the :ref:`tutorials and examples <tutorials-and-examples>` page to learn how to run video transcoding jobs on your |VT2| instance.

***************************************
Installing the |SDK| on an existing AMI
***************************************

In order to use a custom AMI on a |VT2| instance, it is necessary to install the |SDK| in the AMI. This section explains how to do this. These steps are not necessary when using the public |SDK| AMI since it already includes a complete installation of the |SDK| and can readily be used on a |VT2| instance.

Additionally, AWS provides packer scripts to make it easy for customers to build their own AMI’s for use with |VT2| instances. Those scripts can be found at the following repo: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-vt-baseami-pipeline

.. include:: ./include/installation/install_procedure.rst

7. Perform a warm reboot of the instance.

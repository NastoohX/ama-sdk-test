Latency tuning allows for trade off among end to end delay, video bit rate, GOP composition, etc. Interactive applications that require low latency, can do so by setting relevant parameters in the video pipeline. It is understood that lowering the latency comes at the cost of increased bit rate, for a given visual quality.

.. _tuning-decoder-latency:

Decoder Latency
===============
Decoding latency can be reduced by enabling the :option:`-low_latency` decoder option in FFmpeg. 

.. _tuning-encoder-latency:

Encoder Latency
===============

|SDK| encoder performs multi-objective optimization with set constraints on bit rate, GOP topology, visual quality measures, etc. As such, it may be tuned to achieve a compromise between latency and quality or be specialized to ultra low latency.

Guidelines on Encoder Latency Configuration
-------------------------------------------

Encoding latency can also be reduced by trading off compression rate or visual quality. The following table lists the encoder options which can used to reduce to that effect.

   =============================  ===========================
   Encode Options                 Notes
   =============================  ===========================
   Look Ahead Depth               | For best visual quality, it is recommend to set the lookahead depth to 1/3 of the frame rate; however, this also increases latency proportionally to the requested depth. It is possible to reduce latency at the expense of visual quality by reducing the lookahead depth.
   QP Mode                        | Any option other than *uniform* requires extra processing and hence will increase the pipeline delay.
   Scaling List                   | Disabling this option skips over a visual quality refinement process and as such will reduce the pipeline delay.
   Adaptive Quantizations (AQ)    | Temporal and Spatial AQ require extra processing stage and will increase the pipeline delay. Disabling AQ will improve encoding latency.
   Rate Control                   | Setting this to any option other than *low latency* will result in extra delay.
   Number of B frames             | It is understood that for every inserted B frame there will be a frame period delay.
   =============================  ===========================

Ultra Low Latency (ULL) Mode
----------------------------

Ultra Low Latency (ULL) encoding is enabled by setting :option:`-lookahead_depth` flag to 0. 

.. rubric:: Notes

- The ultra low latency encoding mode is not compatible with either B frames or adaptive QP, i.e., both cases result in an immediate termination of the video pipeline. This implies that only CQP and CBR rate control modes are compatible with ULL.

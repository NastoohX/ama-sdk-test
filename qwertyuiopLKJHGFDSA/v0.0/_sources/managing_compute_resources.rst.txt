Managing Video Acceleration Compute Resources
#############################################

.. note::
   This page describes how to manage video acceleration resources and run multiple jobs on given machine through the Xilinx Resource Manager (XRM). For information about managing multiple tasks across a cluster of machines using orchestration services (i.e Kubernetes or EKS), refer to the following page: :ref:`Deploying with Kubernetes <deploying-with-kubernetes>`.

Introduction
************

The notion of compute units (CUs) and CU pool is central to resource management. A typical video transcode pipeline is made of multiple CUs such as decoder, scaler, lookahead, and encoder. These together form a CU pool. Based on the input resolution and type of transcode, the load of CUs within a CU pool varies. The number of required resources determines how many parallel jobs can run in real-time. CUs and CU pool are managed by the Xilinx® resource manager (XRM). XRM is a software layer responsible for managing the video hardware accelerators available in the host system. |SDK| compilable cards have a set processing capacity, e.g., an MA35 device is capable of an aggregate processing equivalent of 2 4kp60 streams. XRM allows for running and managing multiple heterogeneous job, in parallel, on all devices hosted in a chassis. It is noted that XRM strictly adheres to the total capacity of the hosted accelerators, i.e., it does not allow for over-subscription of resources.


The rest of this guide explains how to:

#. Assign jobs to specific devices :ref:`using explicit device identifiers <using-explicit-device-ids>`
#. Measure device load and determine where to run jobs using either :ref:`manual <manual-resource-management>` or :ref:`automated  <using-job-descriptions>` resource management techniques
